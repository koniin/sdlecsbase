- you can only have one type of each fighter type (Interceptor, Cruiser & Destroyer)
	- no mixed weapons etc
- there is always a mothership for each fleet

bugs:
- spawning a ship at the same time as its destroyed makes it so no more ships are spawned?

 next:
    = Goal:  CORE LOOP

	to make fighters and weapons without re-compiling we need;
	
	[ ] Load fighters from file (use weapons by id from weapons data) 
	[ ] Load starting units for player and enemy from file 
	 
	[ ] work on actual units 
		- more health
		- less difference between units (health wise)
		=> we do not implement dodge/evasion etc 
		=> we do not implement different armor types etc 
		 ==> make it ok as is and 
	
	[ ] Evaluate (do we continue ?)

	[ ] make it so there are three total rows and fighters spawn in those rows automatically
		- split the screen in three rows
	[ ] implement to select what row to spawn in (row makes more sense since its side view (so its like darkest dungeon but multiple rows))
	[ ] fighters prioritize fighters in the same row
		or fighters only fire at enemies in the same row 
	[ ] rock paper scissors fighters 
		

	[ ] column/row implications

	- make fighters 
		-> first layer is ;

		- rock paper scissors
		  - shields are good against energy weapons
		  - hull plating is good against kinetic weapons
		  - reactive armor is good against explosive weapons
		
		-> second layer is ;

		- tank, melee dps, ranged (like that)
		  - 

	=============

	Three columns, any fighter in any column, prioritizes to fire on fighters in same column or different fighters prioritize different columns and get different bonuses/no negatives
		- interceptors - same column
		- cruiser - adjacent
		- destroyer - far
		So it's just a type and has nothing to do with hp/shield?

	=============
	
	Could also be nine zones of control and you can only spawn in an owned zone
	Or spawn in any zone
	Rules from other mail could still apply

	For any zone (9 or three columns ) it could give bonuses if you have X ships in X zone/s

	You could also do rows, select what row to spawn in and ships move forward (or not) in that row and can only fire in that row (unless empty and then you get flanking bonus
	Ships can't change row (or they can later)
	Basically it's three Vs three and you need to counter the other ship
	So you queue up ships?
	Or there are front line column and transport column
	Some ships can only fire in front and some can fire in both
	Or there are penalties while in transport

	Or it's three total columns and you select where to spawn to counter the ships in the current column

	Auto darkest dungeon
	Three rows and you select row to spawn in
	Also columns, ships move to the column closest to the enemy columns automatically when space is available
	So to keep a ship in the "right" column you need to keep the other column occupied

	Need to be able to iterate "fast" on this logic
	Keep it separate somewhere.

	==================

	I'm du vill ha mindre ring kan evasion Eller Dodge eller någon sådan mechanic vara som sköld att 
	man alltid evadar ett visst antal hits, som laddar upp igen eller inte

	Kan också vara att man får en miss mot sig var x:e träff

	Mer speed kan vara högre evade men lägre träff-chans

	About positioning and stuff
	Avoidance and evasion is probably good stats
	Since there is no movement it could substitute for movement in some way
	"Fast/light" fighters could have more avoidance or evasion so they are better against slow firing weapons

	Also could have speed as an evasion like stat

	Like armour/life/es and evasion/dodge in Poe :)


	======================

		so row should not matter , but column should
		- flanking is then not possible?
		- could be three rows (can be many ships in each square)
		- could be flanking damage if shooting at a fighter in another row


		  
		- positioning
		  - range ? like has 1 column range (can only shoot when in first row etc)
		  	- does it even do something? you'll just put whatever unit you get in the correct spot
		  - easier to hit fighters in closer columns
		  - system where you can move all fighters from one column to another or one row to another
		  - different weapons will be fired depending on where the fighter is (like long range missiles and short range)
		  - only spawn in some column ?
		  - more damage when in some column/s ?
		  - fighters only shoot against current row (unless empty?)
		

			- aggro => like some ships are more threatening (more likely to get targeted)

		  

		  => all these are if there is some implication if we are in some column, not the reason for having columns
		  	- so what is the reason to have columns?
			- flanking - without selecting position this is useless
			- harder to hit farther away
			- different attack patterns (?) depending on what column a unit is in 
			- tanks / support / dps ? 
		  
		  darkest dungeon does same row and only certain ranges 

		combat 
		- more distance between ships (player - enemy)
		- MORE health for all ships and/or more shields / faster recharge
			-> more shield/faster recharge makes it so more ships are needed to actually kill stuff

		- status effects - on fire, x disabled, crew low morale etc

		- rock/paper/scissors 
			- energy weapons < shields
			
Scout/tank/artillery

Artillery can also be missiles

Deploy zones? Front,middle,back? Depending on range ?

Some weapons only work in certain positions like darkest dungeon

Perhaps there should be more difference between fighters like heavy on shields and some weapons are good against that etc

you can have more types of fighters but only use x in battle

What if we don't have three types where one is more powerful than the other like interceptors, cruiser etc 
but they are more equal like fighters in nowhere prophet
Also then you select which column to spawn it in

You have a "team of fighters" like in teamfight tactics

More rock paper scissors units so you select units to counter the enemy's units


		- juice prio
			- show shields 
			- buttons/icons for launching
			- buttons/icons for abilities

		JUICE TIME - actually making it look a little more ok
		- see if juice doc from shooter is still there
		- buy cheap things like ui and sprites

		- explosions
		- particles
		- shake (screen, ships)
		- lerp
		- ships should move a little
		- Icons for abilities and things
		- event ui - just do something simple like FTL ui
		- buying UI - some better looking buttons
		- map selection ui (just a tiny bit - sprites instead of lines and circles)
		- hide research and make the buttons nicer
		

		more inbetween things
		- research things (upgrades) 
			- faster firing for ships but less damage
			- stronger shields (less damage from energy weapons)
			- new (interceptor, cruiser, destroyer) types
			- etc etc 
		- find pop, find resources
		- find fighter types (after battles etc)
		- moving on the map should be something moving on the line (like a dot moving from current to next node)

		events
		- morale choices vs resources
		- risk vs reward
		- weird shit
		- pop vs resources 
		
		- is energy fully charged on entering level scene or does it carry over from last?
			if it carries over it will be harder to play when you fled last time

		- resource for special weapons? like missiles etc

		- chose what to charge (like ftl power selection)
		 => like star trek reroute power to X (and FTL ;D)
			- energy recharge gets allocated to something
			- so you might allocate energy charge to launch bay for interceptors or cruisers 
				or to an ability or special weapon etc 
			- if you change allocation that charge gets depleted or stays the same 
			- something is always allocated but never goes over max for that 
			- launh bays could have steps like you can charge 4 interceptor spawns 
				and then one ability spawn and then do it all at once
				-> same thing with current system but not something you chose...
			=> can be implemented as what you have now but with a map of charge system => energy bar

		- more map resources (like food/fuel/hope/belief/confidence/ambition)
		- select where to spawn fighters when they are built
			- so you select what to spend energy on and then when you have some fighters created you can select 
			  which column and row to spawn them in
		- taunt - for fighters
		- disabling stuff (disable enemy mothership so it cant gain energy etc)
		- environmental effects (FTL)
		- stalemate => button to withdraw like FTL
		- multiple blueprint/fighters and select which one to spawn/charge with energy

		 Start with simple (AVOID FEATURE CREEP)
		 	=> Vlaamber method of making games: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBPYCmjDNkM
			- Fighters
				- list of fixed fighters (like weapons in nuclear throne and FTL)
					- fighters have one or more weapons
				- fighters are the guns

Furious space battles => Many ships
	 = MORE HEALTH FOR Ships


So simplest is if your fighters do little damage but are many

Fighters are really cheap to replace (but still cost population)

You get new pop at every unvisited node (after event)

Big question is how to introduce more strategy into the combat but we can probably look at others
Positioning, how can we solve this easy?

Also we need to make weapons (aka fighters)


Lanes
Three

Reinforce/spawn/summon
Select lane where to reinforce during battle

Fighters/Weapons have range like darkest dungeon

Also different effectivenes in different lanes?


We should really focus on making the game playable forward
Not add more features
Start doing weapons/fighters and difficulty balancing

Building fighters and getting new fighters
And resources and population costs

Take from ftl if you want to get the feel of numbers

Slower ramping difficulty

Also an end to the game

And choice events

Scout/tank/artillery

Artillery can also be missiles

Deploy zones? Front,middle,back? Depending on range ?

Some weapons only work in certain positions like darkest dungeon


			TO IMPLEMENT:
				=> start with can show anywhere
					- then we can restrict to when the fleet is docked or whatever
				=> list of fighter blueprints
					-> show how many u got
					-> show what it has
					-> show cost to add

			- Upgrades are fleet wide
				- when to get?
					- research -> costs resources and gives three random choices to select from
						- cost => resources
					- only once per node

			TO IMPLEMENT:
				=> Research UI
					=> Big button "Research"
						=> show three outcomes (buttons)
						=> add to game_state when selected

			Mothership upgrades/new weapons/abilities
			=> Investigate/Think about it

			Game improvements
				UI
				- could try making the research and fleet UI default
					and then have "star map" as a button instead

				Research
				- different categories to research? weapons/defense/mods or something?

				Battle
				- target selection (click one then click the target)
				- some kind of movement or positioning
					- like darkest dungeon (order etc)
					- lanes?
					- different modifiers by lane?
					- range for weapons?
				- weapons that other things than damage
					- healing (hull/shield regeneration)
					- disabling effect
					- limited but powerful?
					- aoe damage?


		Core loop
		- select node
		- play event
		- repeat


		- fight the battle -> get a reward
		- station - buy things with resources (different values for different resources at different places?)
		- resource node - get resources 
		- after fight handle ship/fleet business

		FTL - Ship UI is always present
			- when going to a new node it's just a matter of shrinking the ship => change background => resize the ship => show text
			- everything is in the "same scene"

		Required parts
		- node map + UI
		- Population connection to ships
		- Fleet Handling UI
			- mothership slots (weapons / utilities)
			- fighter slots 


	= Look at "Items/Skills" further down for more ideas
	- Make base weapons (like a few base energy weapons, kinetic, explosive and molten)
		-> weapons DB
		https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons
		https://nuclear-throne.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons
	- Make upgrades / abilities
		-> item db (think binding of isaac or nuclear throne like things)
		https://forager.gamepedia.com/Skills
		https://bindingofisaac.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Items

	- spawn in ships at start of battle (warp them in)
		- show it small and scale to correct size in some time 
		- show some effect over it (behind it)
		- add ships to one list, move them in and then move to correct list?
		- so two vectors, one with ships and one with data struct (spawn_time, timer)
		  when timer is up you add the ship to the other list (e.g. _fighter_ships)
		  and spawn the warp effect?


- SHIELD PIERCE (as a upgrade/ability/skill)

Void bastards notes:
only forward travel

Repair after battles (only?)
So that's what food are for

So for your game it's to assign or "build" new ships using resources + population

Then you can have population/resource events
Rescue people etc
Or fights against other things etc

Select load out before mission
Also see info about what types of enemies and loot

Some resource that can be gambled for an outcome (like events with sacrifice X to perhaps gain y) with known outcome or not

One time use buys, köp saker, typ bullets (I ditt fall hard hitting shit for mothership) för resources

Samma resources som används för annat

One currency
Rest is crafting mats

Junk squid (förstör noder)
Pure gain nodes (fuel, food, health etc)
Mines (lose health)
Shops (buy things)
Ship nodes (combat)
Roaming extra events (pirates)
Food pack event

Forward is the way to go, downwards is harder

Overall 
===================
Manage your fleet/population
Jump between nodes to do things
Upgrade ship/fleet (upgrade here means find new things and replace old)

- Population
 - decreases when mothership is hit
 - increases sometimes when entering/leaving a node or after an event
 - can also decrease randomly - sickness etc
 - decreases when a fighter is destroyed (could also be that pop ejects before destruction and if you do't leave
 		they can be retrieved)
- Mothership
	- buy/find new weapons / utility abilities (if not full replace old ones)
	- resource capacity max for each resource - start with one resource
- fighters
    - they are like weapons in FTL / Void Bastards

- retreat from a fight can be done (some cooldown and random nearby node)


	Different kinds of setups
	- what data should we work with?
	
	Mothership
		- upgradeable (skill tree / perks / modules)
		- modules/upgrades/research
			- like poe uniques and passives
			- laser engineer (makes lasers better when built)
			- shield maiden (makes shields better when built)
		
		- mothership weapons
			- base weapon + special modules (or research/crafts?)
	
	Fighters
		- craftable/buildable from menu
		- crafts requires materials
		- crafts can be found/bought (blueprints) => fixed list of blueprints
		- click to craft in UI if spot is open in fleet
		- direct craft or time?
		- craft example:
			- double laser ship
			- missile ship
			- extended flak cannon ship
			- fast laser ship (fast laser mk 1-2)
			- gatling laser ship
		
		- random ship layouts (like diablo) or is it fixed ones?
	
So the cookie clicker part could be
- train population -> requires x pop of each type to fly y ship
- research upgrades for the things you found (like passive XP)
- get other resource from basic resource
- standing at the same node for too long could trigger things like population lost in boredom/disease/whatevs


Nodes/Map
===================
- combat
- nothing
- interactions 
	- quest? like chance of x when going to planet?
	- shop?
	- mine planet? (like azurite nodes)
- population "events"

- upgrades that make special options available (like blue options in FTL or special options in Fallout)

- some sense of urgency (like the rebel pursuing in FTL)

- or it could be that you need to stay on a set of nodes to gather shit and then move on 
 - you can only progress to the next system if you have X amount of resource Y

macro level is (like stellaris)
 - delve node map (galaxy map);
 	- star system;
	 	- star, planets, stations, debris fields, artifacts, rock clusters, etc
 - to go between nodes costs some resource 
	- some nodes (systems are pure mining / uninhabitated) -> azurite nodes
		- could be placing things permanently to get resources (like stellaris)
	- some nodes are inhabitated systems - fighting etc
		- hostile zones (boss encounters at al)
		- neutral zones (rewards and loot)

You could make it so you can only move forward and also make it like Drakborgen

Backwards travel prohibited (same as ftl)
Fuel (same as ftl?)
Food also 

Characters have random negative traits

All missions are combat I think, no pure events, yet

Maybe it should be clusters of nodes that are connected 
5 nodes that are connected and one of them is connected to the next X nodes etc

So perhaps each node in the maze you have now is X event nodes instead?

Simple goal is to leave the galaxy
Or go to one of the four ends where you have intel about a habitable planet

Fleet 
=====================
select mothership?
select starting things?

Metagame Health - Population + Mothership health
Population also used to "build ships"?

To make it easy we treat the fleet ships as weapons/systems in FTL
so you "find" other fleet ships and no building or UI to manage them

so a node on the delve map can be "fighter ship"

Then we can have different types of ships like healers or tanks etc 

do they get destroyed in fights or do they respawn at the start of every fight?

Captain on the mothership? 
Crew for mothership and fighters?

Lose population in combat depending on if mothership is hit or not 

Combat
=====================
so enemies could try to escape before the fight is 100% over

- Simple ship to ship battle
		- defensive measures? like anti missiles, beam deflector, whatevs
		- hit/miss/accuracy/crit
		- damage range for weapons? 8-12 etc
		- shield + armor combo (shield regenerates)
		- borderlands weapons [ damage, accuracy, reload time | fire rate (shots/s), projectile count (for burst etc) ]
		- borderlands shield [ regenerates slow ]
			shield regeneration starts after x amount of time
			so if you don't get hit it will start after some time
			"abilities" to not take damage
			"abilities/items" to buff shields (regeneration amount, time, start time etc)
		- you could have different "deployment zones" like front, middle and back and that is the distance to the enemy ships
			which could be good depending on what kind of stats the ship hans

Items/Skills
=====================

	Games to check

	Nova drift:
		- https://nova-drift.fandom.com/wiki/Nova_Drift_Wiki
		- chose gear (base weapon, body and shield)
		- body -> t.ex en som är bra för constructs/mines, en/två som är bra för shield, en för att köra in i saker ( https://nova-drift.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Ships )
		- weapons - 10 bas-vapen (typ flak, rail, split mm  - https://nova-drift.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Weapons)
		- shields - lite som weapons fast med olika saker med skölden - https://nova-drift.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Shields

		- mods - typ "rapid fire" som i sin tur kan uppgraderas i 2 steg till
		- mods kan ändra body, weapons och shield (alla tre) - tror att gears utgör basen och sen räknas mods på det 
		- mods kan också lägga till helt nya saker t.ex att alla projectiler blir homing

	Borderlands
	Magic the gathering / Hearthstone
	Nuclear throne
	Luftrausers
	Binding of isaac
	Halcyon 6
	FTL
	Into the breach

	====

	This is what we can work with atm

		- number of ships in fleet

		- Defense stats
			hp/hull _max
			shield_max
			
			=> SHOULD WE ADD shield_recharge_cooldown   ?
			shield_recharge_rate
			shield_recharge_amount

		- offense stats
			enum DamageType {
				Energy,
				Explosive,
				Kinetic,
				Molten
			} damage_type;

			enum ProjectileType {
				Bullet,
				SmallBullet,
				GreenLazerBeam,
				Missile,
				RedLazerBullet
			};

			enum WeaponProperty {
				Accuracy,
				ReloadTime,
				Damage,
				Projectile_Type,
				Projectile_Count,
				BurstDelay,
				Radius,
				ProjectileSpeed,
				ProjectileSpeedIncrease,
				ProjectileSpeedMax,
			};

			Targeting

Ideas:

EMP Shock - disables a ship completely for x time
Shield disruptor - disables X enemy shields (different versions ?)
Sensor shock - Decreases accuracy (except for beams)
(Super/Mega)Charge - all weapons do x amount of extra damage for x time

Cleanser - removes negative effects
- one for fire also

Fighters are already configured when found/bought/crafted but can be altered by mods 
so fighters come as they are when you find them

Dots ? (negative status effects basically - same as shield disabler etc)
should be simple to implement - just add a component and count and deal damage

Fire Dot - from a projectile (beam)

Healing - heals targets on press or repeatedly

Passives
- chance to double fire
- chance to X, Y, Z (recharge 1 shield, 100 accuracy etc etc)
- X projectiletype does more damage/better accuracy, etc etc (dot/negative)
- enemies take more damage from x Projectile_Type/DamageType (dot/negative)
- shield increase (more shield_max)


================================

Dynamic components
	- dynamic component = move the entity to another list
	- have a linked thing in another list or add the entity reference to another list 
	- or add an item to another list with reference to the entity somehow


Click handlers
================
	(Note: I also want to handle mouse overs, so your method may differ if you don't)
	I define the following components:
	MouseOverTarget, MouseOver, ClickTarget, Clicked, ClickHandled

	I have the following systems:
	MouseOverSystem - goes through all MouseOverTarget entities and adds/removes MouseOver where appropriate
	ClickSystem - goes through MouseOver+ClickTarget and adds Clicked if LMB was pressed.

	then for each kind of clickable entity in my game I have systems like
	CardMouseOverSystem - goes through all Card+MouseOver, (e.g. highlights the card)
	CardClickSystem - goes through all Card+Clicked+Not(ClickHandled), does whatever it needs (this is your "OnClick" method) and adds ClickHandled. 
    (For example, in my case it adds a Dragged component for Drag&Drop).

	Oh, and the ClickSystem also cleans up Clicked+ClickHandled pairs (just removes them).

	I would assume when the ECS matures you will get all but the entity-kind-specific systems built in (just like you don't have to call OnClick yourself in the UI system). 
    Or maybe they will come up with a better method.
