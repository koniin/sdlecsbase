 next:
    = Goal:  CORE LOOP
		
		 Start with simple (AVOID FEATURE CREEP)
		 	=> Vlaamber method of making games: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBPYCmjDNkM
			- Fighters
				- list of fixed fighters (like weapons in nuclear throne and FTL)
					- fighters have one or more weapons
				- fighters are the guns


We should really focus on making the game playable forward
Not add more features
Start doing weapons/fighters and difficulty balancing

Building fighters and getting new fighters
And resources and population costs

Take from ftl if you want to get the feel of numbers

Slower ramping difficulty

Also an end to the game

And choice events



			TO IMPLEMENT:
				=> start with can show anywhere
					- then we can restrict to when the fleet is docked or whatever
				=> list of fighter blueprints
					-> show how many u got
					-> show what it has
					-> show cost to add

			- Upgrades are fleet wide
				- when to get?
					- research -> costs resources and gives three random choices to select from
						- cost => resources
					- only once per node

			TO IMPLEMENT:
				=> Research UI
					=> Big button "Research"
						=> show three outcomes (buttons)
						=> add to game_state when selected

			Mothership upgrades/new weapons/abilities
			=> Investigate/Think about it

			Game improvements
				UI
				- could try making the research and fleet UI default
					and then have "star map" as a button instead

				Research
				- different categories to research? weapons/defense/mods or something?

				Battle
				- target selection (click one then click the target)
				- some kind of movement or positioning
					- like darkest dungeon (order etc)
					- lanes?
					- different modifiers by lane?
					- range for weapons?
				- weapons that other things than damage
					- healing (hull/shield regeneration)
					- disabling effect
					- limited but powerful?
					- aoe damage?


		Core loop
		- select node
		- play event
		- repeat


		- fight the battle -> get a reward
		- station - buy things with resources (different values for different resources at different places?)
		- resource node - get resources 
		- after fight handle ship/fleet business

		FTL - Ship UI is always present
			- when going to a new node it's just a matter of shrinking the ship => change background => resize the ship => show text
			- everything is in the "same scene"

		Required parts
		- node map + UI
		- Population connection to ships
		- Fleet Handling UI
			- mothership slots (weapons / utilities)
			- fighter slots 


	= Look at "Items/Skills" further down for more ideas
	- Make base weapons (like a few base energy weapons, kinetic, explosive and molten)
		-> weapons DB
		https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons
		https://nuclear-throne.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons
	- Make upgrades / abilities
		-> item db (think binding of isaac or nuclear throne like things)
		https://forager.gamepedia.com/Skills
		https://bindingofisaac.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Items

	- spawn in ships at start of battle (warp them in)
		- show it small and scale to correct size in some time 
		- show some effect over it (behind it)
		- add ships to one list, move them in and then move to correct list?
		- so two vectors, one with ships and one with data struct (spawn_time, timer)
		  when timer is up you add the ship to the other list (e.g. _fighter_ships)
		  and spawn the warp effect?


- SHIELD PIERCE (as a upgrade/ability/skill)

	

Overall 
===================
Manage your fleet/population
Jump between nodes to do things
Upgrade ship/fleet (upgrade here means find new things and replace old)

- Population
 - decreases when mothership is hit
 - increases sometimes when entering/leaving a node or after an event
 - can also decrease randomly - sickness etc
 - decreases when a fighter is destroyed (could also be that pop ejects before destruction and if you do't leave
 		they can be retrieved)
- Mothership
	- buy/find new weapons / utility abilities (if not full replace old ones)
	- resource capacity max for each resource - start with one resource
- fighters
    - they are like weapons in FTL / Void Bastards

- retreat from a fight can be done (some cooldown and random nearby node)


	Different kinds of setups
	- what data should we work with?
	
	Mothership
		- upgradeable (skill tree / perks / modules)
		- modules/upgrades/research
			- like poe uniques and passives
			- laser engineer (makes lasers better when built)
			- shield maiden (makes shields better when built)
		
		- mothership weapons
			- base weapon + special modules (or research/crafts?)
	
	Fighters
		- craftable/buildable from menu
		- crafts requires materials
		- crafts can be found/bought (blueprints) => fixed list of blueprints
		- click to craft in UI if spot is open in fleet
		- direct craft or time?
		- craft example:
			- double laser ship
			- missile ship
			- extended flak cannon ship
			- fast laser ship (fast laser mk 1-2)
			- gatling laser ship
		
		- random ship layouts (like diablo) or is it fixed ones?
	
So the cookie clicker part could be
- train population -> requires x pop of each type to fly y ship
- research upgrades for the things you found (like passive XP)
- get other resource from basic resource
- standing at the same node for too long could trigger things like population lost in boredom/disease/whatevs


Nodes/Map
===================
- combat
- nothing
- interactions 
	- quest? like chance of x when going to planet?
	- shop?
	- mine planet? (like azurite nodes)
- population "events"

- upgrades that make special options available (like blue options in FTL or special options in Fallout)

- some sense of urgency (like the rebel pursuing in FTL)

- or it could be that you need to stay on a set of nodes to gather shit and then move on 
 - you can only progress to the next system if you have X amount of resource Y

macro level is (like stellaris)
 - delve node map (galaxy map);
 	- star system;
	 	- star, planets, stations, debris fields, artifacts, rock clusters, etc
 - to go between nodes costs some resource 
	- some nodes (systems are pure mining / uninhabitated) -> azurite nodes
		- could be placing things permanently to get resources (like stellaris)
	- some nodes are inhabitated systems - fighting etc
		- hostile zones (boss encounters at al)
		- neutral zones (rewards and loot)

You could make it so you can only move forward and also make it like Drakborgen

Fleet 
=====================
select mothership?
select starting things?

Metagame Health - Population + Mothership health
Population also used to "build ships"?

To make it easy we treat the fleet ships as weapons/systems in FTL
so you "find" other fleet ships and no building or UI to manage them

so a node on the delve map can be "fighter ship"

Then we can have different types of ships like healers or tanks etc 

do they get destroyed in fights or do they respawn at the start of every fight?

Captain on the mothership? 
Crew for mothership and fighters?

Lose population in combat depending on if mothership is hit or not 

Combat
=====================
so enemies could try to escape before the fight is 100% over

- Simple ship to ship battle
		- defensive measures? like anti missiles, beam deflector, whatevs
		- hit/miss/accuracy/crit
		- damage range for weapons? 8-12 etc
		- shield + armor combo (shield regenerates)
		- borderlands weapons [ damage, accuracy, reload time | fire rate (shots/s), projectile count (for burst etc) ]
		- borderlands shield [ regenerates slow ]
			shield regeneration starts after x amount of time
			so if you don't get hit it will start after some time
			"abilities" to not take damage
			"abilities/items" to buff shields (regeneration amount, time, start time etc)
		- you could have different "deployment zones" like front, middle and back and that is the distance to the enemy ships
			which could be good depending on what kind of stats the ship hans

Items/Skills
=====================

	Games to check

	Nova drift:
		- https://nova-drift.fandom.com/wiki/Nova_Drift_Wiki
		- chose gear (base weapon, body and shield)
		- body -> t.ex en som är bra för constructs/mines, en/två som är bra för shield, en för att köra in i saker ( https://nova-drift.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Ships )
		- weapons - 10 bas-vapen (typ flak, rail, split mm  - https://nova-drift.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Weapons)
		- shields - lite som weapons fast med olika saker med skölden - https://nova-drift.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Shields

		- mods - typ "rapid fire" som i sin tur kan uppgraderas i 2 steg till
		- mods kan ändra body, weapons och shield (alla tre) - tror att gears utgör basen och sen räknas mods på det 
		- mods kan också lägga till helt nya saker t.ex att alla projectiler blir homing

	Borderlands
	Magic the gathering / Hearthstone
	Nuclear throne
	Luftrausers
	Binding of isaac
	Halcyon 6
	FTL
	Into the breach

	====

	This is what we can work with atm

		- number of ships in fleet

		- Defense stats
			hp/hull _max
			shield_max
			
			=> SHOULD WE ADD shield_recharge_cooldown   ?
			shield_recharge_rate
			shield_recharge_amount

		- offense stats
			enum DamageType {
				Energy,
				Explosive,
				Kinetic,
				Molten
			} damage_type;

			enum ProjectileType {
				Bullet,
				SmallBullet,
				GreenLazerBeam,
				Missile,
				RedLazerBullet
			};

			enum WeaponProperty {
				Accuracy,
				ReloadTime,
				Damage,
				Projectile_Type,
				Projectile_Count,
				BurstDelay,
				Radius,
				ProjectileSpeed,
				ProjectileSpeedIncrease,
				ProjectileSpeedMax,
			};

			Targeting

Ideas:

EMP Shock - disables a ship completely for x time
Shield disruptor - disables X enemy shields (different versions ?)
Sensor shock - Decreases accuracy (except for beams)
(Super/Mega)Charge - all weapons do x amount of extra damage for x time

Cleanser - removes negative effects
- one for fire also

Fighters are already configured when found/bought/crafted but can be altered by mods 
so fighters come as they are when you find them

Dots ? (negative status effects basically - same as shield disabler etc)
should be simple to implement - just add a component and count and deal damage

Fire Dot - from a projectile (beam)

Healing - heals targets on press or repeatedly

Passives
- chance to double fire
- chance to X, Y, Z (recharge 1 shield, 100 accuracy etc etc)
- X projectiletype does more damage/better accuracy, etc etc (dot/negative)
- enemies take more damage from x Projectile_Type/DamageType (dot/negative)
- shield increase (more shield_max)


================================

Dynamic components
	- dynamic component = move the entity to another list
	- have a linked thing in another list or add the entity reference to another list 
	- or add an item to another list with reference to the entity somehow


Click handlers
================
	(Note: I also want to handle mouse overs, so your method may differ if you don't)
	I define the following components:
	MouseOverTarget, MouseOver, ClickTarget, Clicked, ClickHandled

	I have the following systems:
	MouseOverSystem - goes through all MouseOverTarget entities and adds/removes MouseOver where appropriate
	ClickSystem - goes through MouseOver+ClickTarget and adds Clicked if LMB was pressed.

	then for each kind of clickable entity in my game I have systems like
	CardMouseOverSystem - goes through all Card+MouseOver, (e.g. highlights the card)
	CardClickSystem - goes through all Card+Clicked+Not(ClickHandled), does whatever it needs (this is your "OnClick" method) and adds ClickHandled. 
    (For example, in my case it adds a Dragged component for Drag&Drop).

	Oh, and the ClickSystem also cleans up Clicked+ClickHandled pairs (just removes them).

	I would assume when the ECS matures you will get all but the entity-kind-specific systems built in (just like you don't have to call OnClick yourself in the UI system). 
    Or maybe they will come up with a better method.
