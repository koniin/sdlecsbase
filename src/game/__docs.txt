    = Goal: 
		- multiple small ships

	- Simple ship to ship battle
		- some buttons to click for "special weapons"
		- hit/miss/accuracy/crit
		- damage range for weapons? 8-12 etc
		- shield + armor combo (shield regenerates)
		- borderlands weapons [ damage, accuracy, reload time | fire rate (shots/s), projectile count (for burst etc) ]
		- borderlands shield [ regenerates slow ]
			shield regeneration starts after x amount of time
			so if you don't get hit it will start after some time
			"abilities" to not take damage
			"abilities/items" to buff shields (regeneration amount, time, start time etc)


Dynamic components
	- dynamic component = move the entity to another list
	- have a linked thing in another list or add the entity reference to another list 
	- or add an item to another list with reference to the entity somehow


Click handlers
================
	(Note: I also want to handle mouse overs, so your method may differ if you don't)
	I define the following components:
	MouseOverTarget, MouseOver, ClickTarget, Clicked, ClickHandled

	I have the following systems:
	MouseOverSystem - goes through all MouseOverTarget entities and adds/removes MouseOver where appropriate
	ClickSystem - goes through MouseOver+ClickTarget and adds Clicked if LMB was pressed.

	then for each kind of clickable entity in my game I have systems like
	CardMouseOverSystem - goes through all Card+MouseOver, (e.g. highlights the card)
	CardClickSystem - goes through all Card+Clicked+Not(ClickHandled), does whatever it needs (this is your "OnClick" method) and adds ClickHandled. 
    (For example, in my case it adds a Dragged component for Drag&Drop).

	Oh, and the ClickSystem also cleans up Clicked+ClickHandled pairs (just removes them).

	I would assume when the ECS matures you will get all but the entity-kind-specific systems built in (just like you don't have to call OnClick yourself in the UI system). 
    Or maybe they will come up with a better method.
