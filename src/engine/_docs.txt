	1. Make the weapon (set modifiers in create_fighter/mothership method)
	2. WeaponComponent make_spawns is where the ProjectileSpawn is created
		- so heres the logic for queueing projectile spawns
		- handles timing of firing and number of projectiles
		- handles targeting of projectiles
	3. spawn projectile system updates the timers and calls
	4. GameController::spawn_projectile
		- adds the actual projectile to the list of projectiles
		- position, velocity, payload etc
	5. system_collisions checks if any collision between objects (circle to aabb)
	5. on collision there is collision_handle (GameController)
		- deletes the projectile etc
		- handles the hit on the target
	6. projectile_deal_damage 
		- handles the hit 
		- uses the payload on the target
	
	7.  display_export renders the projectile
	
	if we spawn a projectile with no velocity and last position to user position
	and current to where the target is with radius
	it will be picked up in collision detection
	
	then we need to render line differently in export
